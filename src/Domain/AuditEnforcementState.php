/**
 * Whether database-level append-only enforcement is actually present on the server holding the trail.
 *
 * The tamper-evidence stack makes two different promises, and this separates them. Digest chaining,
 * the monotonic position, the anchor ledger and verification are *evidence*: they make a mutated,
 * deleted, reordered or inserted row detectable after the fact, and they work on every supported
 * server. The append-only triggers are *prevention*: they make the write fail at the database in the
 * first place. Prevention needs a privilege the server may refuse to grant — a managed MySQL with
 * binary logging enabled and no `SUPER` is the common case — so it is a property of the deployment,
 * never of the release, and it can differ between two installations running identical code.
 *
 * The value is therefore always *observed* from the server's own catalog rather than remembered from
 * whatever the migration managed to do, which is what keeps it true after a dump is restored onto a
 * different server, after a DBA grants the missing privilege, and after someone drops the triggers.
