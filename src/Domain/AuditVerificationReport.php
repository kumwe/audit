/**
 * Outcome of one full verification walk over the audit trail and its anchor ledger.
 *
 * The report either carries no finding — every event digest recomputed, every witness link resolved,
 * every anchor re-derived — or carries exactly the first divergence together with how far verification
 * got before finding it. The counts exist for evidence: a qualification run cites how many events and
 * anchors were actually re-checked, not merely that a command exited zero.
 *
 * It also carries the observed append-only enforcement state, because "the trail verifies" answers a
 * narrower question than operators tend to hear in it. An intact chain on a server whose triggers were
 * never accepted is genuinely intact — nothing has been tampered with that the evidence can see — but
 * it is only *detecting* tampering, where a guarded server also *prevents* it. Reporting the two
 * together is what stops the weaker posture from reading as the stronger one.
