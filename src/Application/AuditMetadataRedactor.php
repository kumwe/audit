/**
 * Last-line redaction applied to audit metadata on its way out of the trail into an archive.
 *
 * Services already record safe context only, so this is a belt-and-braces control rather than the
 * primary one: an archive leaves the installation, often to a ticket or an auditor, and a single
 * credential-shaped value that slipped past a service's discipline would leave with it. Keys are matched
 * against the credential vocabulary `docs/business-security.md` forbids in logs — password, secret,
 * token, key, code, signature, cookie, authorization — and long opaque values are replaced whatever
 * their key is called. Redaction runs on the export path only; the stored row and therefore the row's
 * digest are never touched, so a redacted archive and the live trail still verify against each other
 * through the anchors rather than through the archive's bytes.
